Landform type,Archaeological prediction
1 and 2. Flat to gently undulating dissected tableland/plateau surfaces with occasional low hills ,"Sites occur infrequently and then are mainly quarries and knapping floors where locally available materials have been exploited. Quarries  commonly very large (>1,000m2) with high density artefact scatters (1-10/m2). Where isolated dunes occur they generally contain rich, diverse artefact scatters."
3. Broad drainage depressions surrounding large claypans ,"Sites occur infrequently, mainly on sand dunes around the margins of large moisture-holding depressions. Sites very large with very high artefact densities (>10/m2). High diversity of stone materials and implement types. These characteristics indicate the drainage depressions and associated dunes were focal points for occupation and a range of domestic activities."
4. Plateau surfaces with widely spaced east-west trending sand dunes;  numerous large claypans in the swales,"Sites are medium to large (10-1,000m2) with medium to high artifact densities (0.1-10/m2) and a range of implement types. Artefacts on a low to medium diversity of stone materials. Most sites are artefact scatters on dunes concentrated around pans. In terrain patterns formed on K, A and P site frequencies low to medium. On Czs, where silcrete crops out most frequently, there are quarries and associated knapping floors and site frequency  is very high. Compared with landform types 1, 2 and 3, sites in landform type 4 are more evenly dispersed across the landscape. Artefact scatters occur more frequently, are richer and are more diverse on sand dunes adjacent to pans. Sites in dunes adjacent to quarries (especially silcrete) consist of knapping floors with low diversity of stone material. The richest sites are in dunes adjacent to areas where pans and silcrete quarries occur in close proximity."
5. Plateau surfaces with moderately-spaced dunes covering 30-60% of the landscape. Claypans are smaller and less common than in widely spaced dunes. ,"The nature and distribution of sites follow the same pattern as that for landform type 4 but sites occur less frequently and are less rich. This reflects the less common occurrence of pans and outcrops of raw material, due to the increased cover of sand."
6. Plateau surfaces with closely-spaced dunes covering at least 80 % of the landscape. Claypans are uncommon. ,"Sites occur very infrequently because of the almost continuous cover of sand, the absence of surface water and stone sources, and the practical difficulty in traversing these landscapes."
